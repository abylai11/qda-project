# qda-project

## Goal
Design a statistical process monitoring method for the in-line detection of defects, ie Propose a method to model, analyze and reduce the dimensionality of the in-line inspection data (use this real dataset to test and apply the methods you learn in this course).

- You are expected to work directly on the output Dataframe (you can use all variables or a subset of them, you have full freedom in deciding how to use these data to meet the project work objective)
- You are also free to explore image data processing and analysis methods directly and work directly on the images in addition to (or in place of) using the output dataframe

## Phases

**Phase 1**: use the phase 1 dataset (collected @ MADE) to design your statical process monitoring method -> present your proposed solution in the Phase I report
> report due-date: 23/5/2024 (midnight)

**Phase 2**: you will be provided with other images of parts with different types of defects -> test your previously designed method on the new data and present the result in the Phase II report (Phase II report is much shorter than Phase I report, and it only includes analysis results and discussions related to the new data)
> report due-date: 10/06/2024 (midnight)

- Clearly state all assumptions.  
- Clearly describe and motivate any choice in the design of your method.  
- You are free to test and compare more than one approach (in that case, a trade-off analysis is expected, as well as a clear statement about the best approach).  
- In Phase 2, if you are not happy with the performance of your proposed method, you can also suggest how to tune it or revise it to achieve a more effective defect detection.  
- Any creative solution is welcome.

## Reports and upload
Expected output: a zip folder that includes: 

1. A Python notebook + Dataframe that describes the proposed approach, the used code and functions, all the performed analysis, the assumptions and a discussion of achieved results. The provided template shall be used.

or 

2. Teams who will not use Phython for the project, will be asked to submit a text report in PDF format (the provided template shall be used). Source code or project files + short readme file + Dataframe (only for teams who will not use Phyton).
